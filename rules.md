# X-Team 112 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
1. We will discuss as a team and base jobs on preference. 


## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
1. We will see eachother commiting and pushing their edits to files on GitHub. 
2. If someone seems to be falling behind, we will contact them and offer to help.


## How will we communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
1. We will email other teams members, asking for their help.
2. If we need outside help we will go to the TAs or professors. 


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
1. Hold eachother accountable for what they are assigned to do. 
2. If someone is falling behind, help them catch up so the entire team does not fall behind. 


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
1. Don't make assumptions, communicate with eachother. 
2. Help eachother out when possible.
