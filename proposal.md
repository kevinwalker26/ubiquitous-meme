# X-Team 112 Badger Planner

See https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code for tips on using *Markdown* tags to format __.md__ files

## Goal

Work as a team to create a project proposal for your X-team to complete together.
The project does not have to be extremely difficult,
but there must be work to do for each member of your team.
You may reference figures using "See figure 1".  
Be sure to submit corresponding image files, i.e. figure1.png (or figure1.jpg) for each figure.

## Grading: To earn full credit, your team's proposal must include:

* (md) documentation: [this file] describing purpose and use of your program

* Description of a program that has:

  ** a main Java program class in a file named Main.java
  
  ** a custom data structure designed and built by your team
  
  ** comprehensive testing of individual units
  
 Caution: You are not being asked to implement this program, at least not yet. 
 We just want your group to make a proposal or pitch for your program.
 
 Tip: Your custom data structure can be composed of or extensions of data structures that you have learned and used in previous programming assignments.  We're looking for decisions about how to build a high-level data structure that will likely have lower-level components.

## Problem Description

It can be difficult to keep track of all the things you have going on during the semester. It is common for students to lose track of assignments, exams, and projects and even more common to not start them early enough. What if there was a way for you to insert assignments, exams, and projects into a planner that would automatically start notifying you prior to the due date so you don't forget about it or have to cram?

## Proposed Solution

A program that could solve this problem would store upcoming assignments, exams, and projects and notify the user as the due dates approach. It would change notification beginning times based on the category of the item. These notifications would persist until the due date has passed or the item has been marked as completed. 

## Questions to answer for Exercise #2

1. Name: Badger Planner



2. Output: Describe the output your program will produce. Include and example format of the output produced.

The output will be some sort of notification. The email will be a base string value that is concatenated with the inputs to give an alert. It may have send multiple emails to the end user at different times. Another output would to be display the current outputs of the assingments.


3. Input: Describe the data that is needed to solve your problem. Include an example format of the input data.



4. User Interface: Describe a user interface for your program.  Use text menus or a simple graphic user interface.

The user interface will use a button to add fields to an object to be inserted the assignment planner. The button will open a textbox and that will allow a user to describe the field. The button will allow multiple fields to be added. It will incllude a drag button for inputing the desired urgency of the assignment. It could include a month selection to get the date of the assigment. 


5. Types List: Break your solution idea down into units that you think can be implemented with a single class.



Name each interface or class and briefly describe its function or purpose.
